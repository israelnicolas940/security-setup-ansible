# security-setup-ansible

Reproducible cybersecurity workstation setup provisioned with **Ansible**.

This project automates the setup of a complete security research and penetration testing environment from a clean Linux installation.
The goal is to treat a personal workstation the same way modern companies treat infrastructure: **versioned, documented, reproducible, and disposable**.

Instead of manually installing tools and configuring the system over several days, the entire environment can be recreated in a single command.
